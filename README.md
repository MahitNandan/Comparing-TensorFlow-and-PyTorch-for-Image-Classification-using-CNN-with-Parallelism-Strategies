With an emphasis on convolutional neural net
works (CNNs), this research project does a thorough analysis of
 the effectiveness and suitability of the TensorFlow and PyTorch
 frameworks for image classification tasks. The first objective
 compares runtime efficiency and computing capacity in detail,
 emphasising the effects of data parallelism techniques. The
 focus of Objective 2 is to assess the accuracy and robustness
 of the model, specifically using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The
 study intends to give decision-makers in the deep learning and
 image classification fields insightful information on the real
world consequences of choosing TensorFlow or PyTorch. The
 comparative analysis helps researchers and practitioners alike
 make well-informed decisions by fostering a deeper awareness
 of the advantages and disadvantages of various frameworks.
